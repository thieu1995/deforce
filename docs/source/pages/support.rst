If you want to understand how to use Derivative Free-optimized Cascade Forward Neural Network, you
need to read the paper titled `Optimization of neural-network model using a meta-heuristic algorithm for the estimation of dynamic Poissonâ€™s ratio of selected rock types`.
The paper can be accessed at the following `this link <https://doi.org/10.1038%2Fs41598-023-38163-0>`_
